            <li>2 tablespoons Ethiopian berbere seasoning</li>
            <li>½ cup Ethiopian kibbeh (spiced clarified butter)</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Place onions in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, covered, until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add vegetable oil and garlic paste; cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes; cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
